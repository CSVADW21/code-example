# Colorspace Explorer

My color picker was created to be used by a designer seeking to sample a
palette or mood from an image.

In my past career as a web developer I have use many different
"eye-dropper" color picker tools, and many color palette generators.
This sketch is an attempt to integrate the color-palette generator with
an eye-dropper tool.

The system facilitates exploration and comparison between alternatives
by
* enabling quick/easy/fun sampling
* automatically creating a color palette board

I am inspired by Lafon's interaction model, "Instrumental Interaction,
and sought to treat color swatches as image-sampler instruments.

### Instructions

* Click on the image to create a swatch.

* Click + drag the swatch to sample different arease of the image.

* Shift/ctr/option + click to increase the swatch size. This increases
the sampling area on the image. The resulting fill color is the average
pixel color of the sampled image.

* Press 'c' to clear all swatches.

* Press 'l' to toggle line rendering.

* Hold 'x' and click a swatch to delete it.

* As this was created for designers, the hex color of the last-clicked
  swatch is copied to the system clipboard for easy copy/paste out.
