## parametrization

_going from mechanical objects to mathematical curves, to snakes, to intestinal tracks, to bonsai branches, to the drawing machine, to the spaghetti plate, to the vase maker..._

I began my adventure on parametrization thinking that I would create a _virtual_ mechanical system of simple physical machines. But after a while, a whole system seemed a bit too ambitious for the time being. (I still think that this could be an interesting and useful task for a later assignment, or maybe a final project!). I then started to explore different mathematical curves but was not satisfied with the result.. it just looked like an artsy Mathematica.

So I dived into shapes that would be more meaningful to me. Both Ruth Asawa's and Eva Hesse's work came to inhabit my inspirational headspace. From there, I thought of trying to parametrize an intestinal track/ a snake. My initial goal was to control the diameter of different sections of the shape. I aligned ellipses one after the other first and used sinusoidal functions to modify the direction of the shape. It became obvious that changing the diameter of each section would have been just too many parameters. So I opted to simpler version, modifying the diameter of each ellipse with respect to each other following a _1/(x+1)_ curve. I ended up liking the bonsai-like figure created through this process.

Inspired by Dragan IliÄ‡'s [drawing robot interface](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/surreal-artwork-is-being-created-by-a-robot-arm) that we discussed in class, I added a way to animate the shape and to stop the background to redraw. This gave rise to unexpected objects ranging from a [spaghetti bowl in space](https://github.com/CSVAD/sam/blob/master/projects/week3/param4.png) to a vase maker. The second figure below (which I call the vase maker) is generated like a solid of revolution around the _y_-axis. This is something that could be cool to explore further.
