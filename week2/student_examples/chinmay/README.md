I wanted to get the skull in a more circular pattern without losing it's orientation while some arc made a more nested pattern surrounding the shape. But I wasn't able to get the circular pattern to work. So instead I decided to represent the skull in a similar pattern as the tilings in class for pshape tiling while they are randomly colored. In this wallpaper we have 4 pattern that basically set up the rotation in the 4 directions. We walk through these pattern, while calling the function to draw the skull each time with a different color and rotation. I also added these backgound pattern with tilted lines to form a kind of rectangular shape so each skull falls on the corner of that rectangle.
