When creating my wallpaper, I first drew a grid shape in order to block out/envision the space. Then, I grabbed some of the code from the in-class examples and started altering the shape forms based on what I wanted to create. I like the Processing primitive shapes, so I wanted to create a pattern that combined ellipses, and triangles primarily. I wanted the triangles to create a "background" for the pattern, which would be altered based on rotation, and have the ellipses be a "repeating motif" that was uniform throughout the pattern. After I created this, I realized that something was missing in the center of each grid box; this led me to create the rectangles as a sort of "center" that varied in color and transparency, which added color depth and shape depth to the wallpaper. I know that red and blue and white mix nicely to make pinks and purples, so I decided to base my fill calls on these colors. I then created 3 different programs to run the different scales, but something was still missing. I then looked into recursion to make a "main shape" that was drawn on top of my wallpaper based on the "rectilinear fractal" code example. I altered the scale, the frequency of which the drawSeed function was being drawn, and altered the lines to ellipses in order for it to fit with my wallpaper. The result is something that aesthetically combines to my tastes after trial and error with values for rotation, function calls, shape sizes, and overall pattern size.
